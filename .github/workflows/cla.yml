            Thank you for your contribution to lightNVR! 🎉
            
            Before we can merge your pull request, we need you to sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/CLA.md).
            
            **Why a CLA?**
            lightNVR uses a dual-licensing model. While the project is freely available under GPLv3, OpenSensor Engineering also offers commercial licenses. The CLA ensures we can continue offering both options.
            
            **To sign the CLA**, please reply to this comment with exactly:
            ```
            I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA
            ```
            
            You only need to sign once, and it applies to all future contributions.

            <summary>ℹ️ More about the CLA</summary>
            
            The CLA grants OpenSensor Engineering the right to:
            - Include your contributions under GPLv3 (open source)
            - Offer commercial licenses that include your contributions
            
            You retain copyright of your contributions and can use them in other projects.
